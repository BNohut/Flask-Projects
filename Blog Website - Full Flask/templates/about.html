        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>I am BuÄŸra and I graduated from the department of Survey Engineering at the BlackSea Technical University. I am married and have one daughter.</p>
        <p>In 2021, Somethings happened and I decided to change my life and tried to find something that makes me happy and feel better.
        When I was in university, I always interested in coding and choose my classes for learning how to code.
        However I met with Python and bought a course from Angela Yu which called 100 Days of Coding: Python. With that course, I realized that How much I really like coding, searching for news and excited to run my codes with zero error.
        The coding makes me feel awesome. </p>
        <p>Isn't the coding some sword of magic? I believe it is.</p>
